    This is a test page demonstrating a bug in contenteditable divs and autocorrect in ios webviews which results in duplicate words. To see it in action:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Type a word in the div with an abvious typo so that autocorrect makes a suggestion</li>
    <li>Tab either the link or button</li>
    <li>Autocorrect will insert two copies of the corrected word</li>
</ol>
